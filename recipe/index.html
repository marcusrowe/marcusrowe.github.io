<h1>Craft Mac & Cheese</h1>

<p>
<strong> 1.)What You Need:</strong> Grab yourself some elbow macaroni, a good hunk of cheddar cheese, milk, butter, and a sprinkle of flour—nothing fancy, just what you got.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.)Cook the Pasta:</strong> Fill a pot with water, bring it to a boil like you’re heating up a little action. Toss in the macaroni, and cook it until it’s al dente—don’t overdo it, alright? Drain it and put it aside for now.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.)Make the Cheese Sauce:</strong> In the same pot, melt some butter over medium heat. Toss in a tablespoon of flour and give it a good stir, like you’re mixing up a plan. Gradually whisk in the milk, cooking it until it thickens up nicely.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.) dd the Cheese:</strong> Take it off the heat, and start mixing in your shredded cheese. Let it melt like a warm hug, nice and smooth. Season it with a little salt and pepper—just enough to make it sing.</p>
<p>
 <strong>5.)Combine:</strong> Now, add that cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce, mixing it all together until every piece is coated in that creamy goodness.</p>
<p>
<strong>6.)DONE!</strong> Dish it up, and enjoy your mac and cheese like a true connoisseur. Mangia!</p>
